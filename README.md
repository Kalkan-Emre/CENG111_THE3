# CENG111_THE3
Summary of the description for this take hame exam is given below.

*In this exam, the purpose is to construct a parts inventory. Suppose we work in a bicycle factory, where it is
necessary to keep an inventory of bicycle parts. If we want to build a bicycle, we need to know what is the
total cost of the parts. Each part of the bicycle may have sub-parts; for example, each wheel has some spokes,
a rim and a hub. Furthermore, the hub can consist of an axle and some gears.
Let us consider a tree-structured database that will keep the information about which parts are required to
build a bicycle (or any other composite object). There are two kinds of parts that we use to build our bicycle
(or generally any such composite object): assemblies and basic parts. Each assembly consists of a quantity
of basic parts and (may be) a quantity of other assemblies. Since it is possible to calculate the price of any
composite part, only the unit price for the basic parts are provided.*
